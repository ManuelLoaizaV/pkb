\section{Curvature of surfaces}

\subsection{The second fundamental form}

Suppose that $\sigma$ is a surface patch in $\BR^3$ with standard unit
normal $\bm{N}$.
Writing
\[
  L = \sigma_{uu} \cdot \bm{N},
  M = \sigma_{uv} \cdot \bm{N},
  N = \sigma_{vv} \cdot \bm{N}.
\]
One calls the expression
\[
  L du^2 + 2 M du dv + N dv^2  
\]
the second fundamental form of the surface of patch $\sigma$.

\begin{example}
  Consider the plane
  \[
    \sigma(u, v) = a + up + vq.  
  \]
  Since $\sigma_u = p$ and $\sigma_v = q$, we have
  $\sigma_{uu} = \sigma_{uv} = \sigma_{uv} = 0$.
  Hence, the second fundamental form of a plane is zero.
