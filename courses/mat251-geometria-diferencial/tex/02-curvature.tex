\section{How much does a curve curve?}

\subsection{Curvature}

\begin{defn}
  If $\gamma$ is a unit-speed curve with parameter $t$, its curvature $\kappa(t)$
  at the point $\gamma(t)$ is defined to be $\|\ddot{\gamma}(t)\|$.
\end{defn}

\begin{proposition}
  Let $\gamma(t)$ be a regular curve in $\BR^3$. Then its curvature is
  \[
    \kappa = \frac{\|\ddot{\gamma} \times \dot{\gamma}\|}{\|\dot{\gamma}\|^3},
  \]
  where the $\times$ indicates the cross product.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Plane Curves}

Suppose that $\gamma(t)$ is a unit-speed vector curve in $\BR^2$. Let
\[
  t = \dot{\gamma}
\]
be the tangent vector of $\gamma$, note that $t$ is a unit vector.
There are two unit vectors perpendicular to $t$; we make a choice by defining $n_s$,
the signed unit normal of $\gamma$, to be the unit vector obtained by rotating $t$
anticlockwise by $\pi/2$.
$\dot{t} = \ddot{\gamma}$ is perperndicualr to $t$, and hence parallel to $n_s$.
Thus, there is a scalar $\kappa_s$ such that
\[
  \ddot{\gamma} = \kappa_s n_s.
\]
$\kappa_s$ is called the signed curvature of $\gamma$. Since $\|n_s\| = 1$, we have
\[
  \kappa = \|\ddot{\gamma}\| = \|\kappa_s n_s\| = |\kappa_s|,
\]
so the curvature of $\gamma$ is the absolute value of its signed curvature.

\begin{corollary}
  The total signed curvature of a closed plane curve is an integer multiple of $2\pi$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $k: (\alpha, \beta) \to \BR$ be any smooth function.
  Then, there is a unit-speed curve
  $\gamma: (\alpha, \beta) \to \BR^2$ whose signed curvature is $k$.
  Further, if $\tilde \gamma: (\alpha, \beta) \to \BR^2$ is any other unit-speed curve
  whose signed curvature is $k$, there is a direct isometry $M$ of $\BR^2$ such that
  \[
    \tilde \gamma(s) = M(\gamma(s)) \text{ for all } s \in (\alpha, \beta).
  \]
\end{theorem}
